**Our Mission:** 👩🏾‍🏫👩🏻‍⚕️👩🏿‍💻👩🏽‍🚀👩🏻‍🌾👩🏼‍🔬👩🏽‍💼
The Women in Science Portland Organization provides professional and personal development opportunities to early career scientists and professionals, particularly students and post-docs, placing special emphasis on the support and growth of women in science. 
These goals will be met through inspirational mentors, informative workshops, community outreach, networking opportunities, and other programming designed to promote healthy and productive environments for addressing issues related to the development and retention of women in science. 

We involve scientists from all career levels to mentor early career scientists and advance our mission. 

The Women in Science Organization will not discriminate on the basis of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, creed, race, handicap, or national origin and will welcome all who promote innovative and responsible scientific development.
